# Wait-Time-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing wait times at the Lewiston Bridge crossing between Canada and the US using regression analysis. The data used in this project is obtained from the Canadian government's open data portal and covers the period from 2010-2014.

The main objective of this project is to build regression models to predict wait time at the Lewiston Bridge crossing based on various factors such as time of day, day of the week, month, and other holidays. Two variants of the model are run, OLS using wait time as a continuous variable and logistic using wait time as a categorical variable.

The report presents a formal analysis of the data, including feature engineering techniques to measure X variables, and judgment to construct the Y variable for the logistic model. The results are presented using appropriate tables and plots, and a discussion is provided comparing the two models. The project also involves predicting wait times in 2015 Q1 using the models developed.

Finally, the report concludes with a discussion of additional features that can improve the model and demonstrates data sense.
